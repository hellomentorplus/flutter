Lesson 2: 
- function (with optional param, and named param)
- class: constructor, final param, late final

Homework:
Given a list of integer, find a pair(s) of numbers that makes the minimum sum value

Example: 
- List: 0, 3,6,5,3,1,2,9
=> Pairs available: 
0, 3 => sum(0, 3) = 3
3, 6 => sum(3, 6) = 9
6, 5 => sum(6, 5) = 11
5, 3 => sum(5, 3) = 8
3, 1 => sum(3, 1) = 4
1, 2 => sum(1, 2) = 3,
2, 9 => sum(2, 9) = 11

Expected output: (0, 3), and (1, 2)
